    <h1>Coffee</h1>
    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.</p>
    <h3>Why Coffee</h3>

    <p>Coffee is a beloved beverage known for its ability to fine-tune your focus and boost your energy levels.

        In fact, many people depend on their daily cup of joe right when they wake up to get their day started on the right foot.
        
        In addition to its energizing effects, coffee has been linked to a long list of potential health benefits, giving you all the more reason to get brewing.</p>
        <h4>Benifits</h4>
        <p>1. Boosts energy levels
Coffee contains caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant that is known for its ability to fight fatigue and increase energy levels (1Trusted Source).

This is because caffeine blocks the receptors of a neurotransmitter called adenosine, and this increases levels of other neurotransmitters in your brain that regulate your energy levels, including dopamine</p> 
<p>2. May be linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes
    Some research suggests that consuming coffee regularly could be associated with a decreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes over the long term.</p>
<p>3. Could support brain health
    Although studies have turned up mixed results, some research suggests that coffee may help protect against certain neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.</p>

    <p>4. May promote weight management
        According to some research, coffee could alter fat storage and support gut health, both of which may be beneficial for weight management.
        
        For example, one review of 12 studies concluded that higher coffee consumption could be associated with decreased body fat, especially in men (14Trusted Source).
        
        In another study, increased coffee intake was linked to decreased body fat in women.
        
        Furthermore, one study found that people who drank one to two cups of coffee per day were 17% more likely to meet recommended physical activity levels, compared with those who drank less than one cup per day (16Trusted Source).
        
        Higher levels of physical activity could help promote weight management .</p>

        <p>5. Linked to a lower risk of depression
            Some studies have found that drinking coffee could be associated with a lower risk of depression.
            
            According to one review of seven studies, each cup of coffee people consumed per day was linked to an 8% lower risk of depression.
            
            Another study found that drinking at least four cups of coffee each day was associated with a significantly lower risk of depression, compared with drinking just one cup per day </p>
